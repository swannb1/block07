//pseudocode: create an equation for variable num1 that equals 10
//pseudocode: create an equation for variable num2 that equals 40
//pseudocode: create an equation for variable num3 that equals 39
//pseudocode: Create a variable for a greeting that says, "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination: num1 - num2 - num3"
//pseudocode: create an alert that displays the greeting variable with the variables num1, num2 and num3 at the end

// first create the variables with three different equations
let num1 = 19-18+9
let num2 = 20*10/5
let num3 = num2-1

//next create the greeting to include the desired message
const greeting = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:"

//next create the pop-up alert
//remember to include dashes between variables to make it easier to differentiate the numbers in the pop-up
//include a space after the greeting and before num1
alert(greeting + " " + num1 + "-" + num2 + "-" + num3);
